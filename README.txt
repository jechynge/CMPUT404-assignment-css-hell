Where I got that terrible lens flare photo:

I used some assets that were freely available on the web, including some fonts and a colour theme generator. These are documented in the appropriate sections of the CSS files.

For the Gutenberg files, I stripped out any styles defined in the html <head> tags, but left anything that was defined at the tag level. I also removed any links to files that didn't exist. Specifically for Heart of Darkness, I had to change a few of the header tags to be more appropriate (i.e. the title was in an h3 instead of an h1 tag). Otherwise, the files are as they were when I obtained them from the Project Gutenberg website.
