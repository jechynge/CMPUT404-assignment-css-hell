                    <h3>an introduction</h3>
                    <p>My name is Jordan Ching. I'm a full-time computer nerd, part-time gamer, and part-time car enthusiast.
                    <h4>So...jechynge? What gives?</h4>
                    <img class='right' src="images/profile.jpg" />
                    <p>Eagle-eyed readers may have noticed that my handle - jechynge - is spelled funny. Why? Well, jeching was taken when I signed up for twitter, so I used an older spelling of my family name, Chynge.</p>
                    <h4>What I do</h4>
                    <p>As I said previously, my main hobby and choice of profession is computers. I'm currently studying Computing Science at the University of Alberta while also pursuing completion of the Video Game Development Certificate.</p>

                        <h3>what i've done</h3>
                        <p>I'm still working towards completing my Bachelor's Degree in Computing Science, so I have yet to officially join the ranks of those who have a proper job. However, I've managed to get glimpses of the professional world on occasion, as detailed below.</p>
                        <h4>Software Developer - General Electric Intelligent Platforms</h4>
                        <h5>Spring 2012 - Fall 2013</h5>
                        <img src="images/ge.jpg" class="right" />
                        <p>As part of my degree, I participated in the Industrial Internship Program offered by the Computing Science department. At GEIP, I worked as part of a team developing web services focused on industrial automation using a variety of internet technologies, including Microsoft's MVC4 framework and their Azure cloud services.</p>
                        <p>During my time there, I was a member of several different teams, all operating as an agile scrum. I was expected to participate both in daily stand-ups and regular sprint planning meetings. In addition, since we were designing a new service from scratch, I had to provide design input for the features we were expected to implement.</p>
                        <h4>Online Editor/Webmaster - <em>The Gateway</em> Student Newspaper</h4>
                        <h5>2010 - 2012, 2013 - present</h5>
                        <img src="images/gateway.jpg" class="right" />
                        <p>I was hired at The Gateway just before the start of my third year at the U of A as the Online Editor. My duties included both editorial responsibilities like running the blogs on the website and contributing to the paper in addition to technical responsibilities like maintaining the website and the fleet of computers used to produce the paper.</p>
                        <p>In the summer of 2011, I was tasked with rebuilding the website to coincide with a complete redesign of the newspaper. That version of the website has been in service since then.</p>
                        <p>After my internship at GEIP, I returned to The Gateway as their Webmaster. I still had the same technical duties, but would no longer have editorial obligations. Instead, I focused on refactoring our website's code as well as implementing new features at the request of our editorial and business teams.</p>

            <div class="body_container">
                <div class="content_wrapper">
                    <section id="skills">
                        <h3>what i can do for you</h3>
                        <p>Besides the technical abilities I've listed above, there are plenty of great reasons why I make a great employee. Having worked on plenty of team-based projects, I'm effective at playing my part in groups of differing sizes. From small three or four person teams to a 14-person newsroom, I'm flexible and integrate well into group-based environments. Conversely, I'm comfortable working on solo projects as well.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, I've also got excellent communication skills from working in the aforementioned team environments as well as having served as part of The Gateway's editorial team. Working with volunteers and other editors was an almost daily occurrence, and I was expected to produce written content on a semi-regular basis for both the print and online versions of the paper.</p>
                        <p>Finally, having worked with a great deal of technologies, I've developed strong problem solving skills. I was working at GEIP when we started leveraging Microsoft's Azure platform, and we didn't have an in-house expert who we could rely on for guidance. This resulted in a lot of troubleshooting and referencing of documentation. Working at The Gateway was also invaluable in this regard, as I was the primary source of technical support. Whether it was one of our databases getting corrupted or the hard drive giving out in someone's computer, I was expected to come up with answers to the technological mishaps that threatened the publishing schedule.</p>
